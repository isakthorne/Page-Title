        <p>
My name is Isak, I am a student at Purdue Polytechnic High School, and I am a programmer for my First Robotics Competition (FRC) team, 7457 suPURDUEper Alpha. I am currently enrolled in the NextTech Catapult program. I am learning more about coding so I can be a better programmer. I wish to pursue a career in computer science, preferably cybersecurity. On my free time I enjoy reading weightlifting and going camping.</p>
